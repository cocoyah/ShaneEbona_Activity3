			An urban legend states that those exceptionally gifted at gaming will be sent a special game invitation, and the winners of the challenge will be whisked away to another world. When Sora and Shiro, two hikikomori NEETs who happen to be both siblings and notorious gamers, receive this invitation, they defeat it with ease. And like the legends tell, they're transported to another world where conflicts, peoples' lives and even country borders are decided by competitions and games. Always up for a challenge, the pair quickly take on the obstacles that come their way, whether it be restoring lowly humanity's good name compared with the other races or helping influence who will become the next king.

			<br>Movie (1 ep x 94 min)
			<br><br>
			For nearly fourteen years, Arrietty has lived with her parents under the floorboards of a house. As 'tiny people', the family must remain hidden from humans, 'borrowing' items from them such as postage stamps or herbs to cook with. Arrietty is old enough to borrow for the first time, and alongside her father, the two explore the house in search of tissue and sugar. But when the pair is spotted by Sho, a boy who is visiting his great aunt, Arrietty's parents fear for their safety. However, unlike her family, Arrietty is convinced that not all humans are dangerous, and together she and Sho form an unlikely friendship.
